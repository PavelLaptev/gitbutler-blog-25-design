      Going down the rabbit hole of Git's new bundle-uri

    <p class="hero-excerpt">
      Git's new bundle-uri could help significantly speed up clones, but what
      bugs lurk within?

    <p class="hero-description">
      This all started with me trying to figure out the state of a feature that
      I had heard about from GitLab's Gitaly project called bundle-uri, which
      allows you to, in theory, speed up a clone by downloading a cached file
      that seeds your project's data before doing a server CPU-intensive fetch.
      In a nutshell, when you clone a Git repository, the git clone command will
      start a conversation with the Git server you're connecting to in order to
      figure out what all is available on the server and what it would like to
      get.
